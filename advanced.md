# Advanced Markdown Syntax

## Code Blocks

For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks before and after the code.

Example: ``def hello_world(): print("Hello, world!")``

---

## Checklists

Markdown also supports checklists, which are useful for tracking tasks or project management.

Example:

- [X] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## GitHub-Flavored Markdown

### Syntax Highlighting

You can specify programming languages for syntax highlighting within code blocks:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
